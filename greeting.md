You can use this sidebar to filter and sort the data based on the columns available in the `IC50_expr_cnv.csv` table. Here are some examples of the kinds of questions you can ask me:

1. Filtering: "Show only NRAS Wild Type cell lines"
2. Sorting: "Show all data sorted by IC50 in ascending order."
3. Answer questions about the data: "How does IC50 compare between skin and soft tissue cell lines?"

You can also say "Reset" to clear the current filter/sort, or "Help" for more usage tips.
